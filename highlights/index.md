Our class just got done finishing our American Symbols unit. We got to make fake passports, suitcases, and travel brochures. We traveled around the United States in our classroom and visited different destinations such as the Statue of Liberty, the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial, Niagra Falls, Mount Rushmore, and more. We learned about symbols such as the American Flag and the Bald Eagle. The students worked on an opinion writing about what American symbol they thought was the most important. Check out some great pictures of our fun in action!

In math class we are working hard on addition and strategies to add. We have been using a lot of manipulatives and working with partners to really get these concepts down! Here are a few pictures of the students hard at work! In this lesson the students dropped pom-poms onto a part-part-part-whole mat. They made their addition sentences with 3 addends and figured out their sum. They discussed strategies to add the numbers like finding doubles, near doubles, or making a ten to add. They did a great job!

In Social Studies we are doing our Maps & Globes unit and are learning a lot. We have been learning features on a map such as a scale, map key or legend, compass rose, latitude, and longitude. We have been working a lot on our cardinal and intermediate directions using our compass rose. The students have studied maps and used their compass to navigate to destinations. Today we created our own &#8220;Mystery Maps&#8221; with symbols and wrote directions to our mystery location. We switched with a friend and had them follow our directions to find the mystery place. Here are two wonderful examples of what they looked like. They were a lot of fun to make and solve! We can&#8217;t wait to learn more and do more cool projects!
