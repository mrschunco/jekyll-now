Parents are now able to access their child&#8217;s grades through the parent portal at the following link: <https://scsparentportal.sarasota.k12.fl.us/portal/>

You will need to set up an account if you have never used the program before. To have access you will also need your child&#8217;s N# as well as their lunch pin number.

Grades in my grade book are updated **<span style="text-decoration: underline;">weekly</span>**. Spelling tests are always given on Thursdays, and reading tests are on Fridays. These tests will be graded Friday evening or through the weekend and then put into my grade book. All tests from the previous week will be sent home in Friday folders.

There has been a new change to the 2nd grade report card. This year your child will be given letter grades in **ALL** subject areas as well as an effort grade. Reading, Written Communication, Spelling, Handwriting are no longer separate subjects this year. They are grouped together as Language Arts. Your child&#8217;s grades will be weighted in Language Arts and will be broken down in the following way:

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Reading- 40%</strong></span> (Weekly Reading Tests, Unit Tests, Phonics, Fluency, Benchmark Tests, Projects)<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br /> </strong></span>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Writing- 40%</strong></span>** **(Responding to Reading, Writing Prompts, Type 2 writing)

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Speaking & Listening-</strong></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> 10%</strong> </span>(Performance Tasks)

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Language- 10%</strong></span><strong> </strong>(Spelling, Vocabulary/Word Meaning, Conventions/Grammar, Handwriting)
</p>
