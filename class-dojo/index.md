In our classroom we will be using a program called Class Dojo for behavior. It is an amazing tool that will help build your child&#8217;s learning habits and focus on correct behavior in the classroom. Class Dojo will allow me to keep track of these behaviors in the classroom every day. Your child can either be awarded a point or have one taken away for specific behaviors. Reports can be generated for the day, week, month, year, etc. The best part is you can get involved! If you print out and fill out the parent form below with an e-mail address and send it in to me, reports can be sent to you. Once I have your e-mail address I will send you a special code to log in on the website to monitor your child&#8217;s behavior reports.

Your child can even get their own code where they can log-in and check out their reports.They can even change their avatar. Some parents like to use this as a reward for <img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-232" src="http://www.mrschunco.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ClassDojo-avatar7-225x300.png" alt="ClassDojo-avatar7" width="225" height="300" />a positive week with behavior!
