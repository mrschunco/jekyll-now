It&#8217;s finally here! The students have been working so hard practicing their play and parts. We will continue to practice all this week for our grand show on Thursday. The students will be performing their 2nd grade play &#8220;Let&#8217;s Sing America&#8221; on Thursday October 23rd. The school will see it in the morning at 8:45 am, and we will be performing once again for families at 6:00 pm. Please remember to dress your child on Thursday in jeans or black pants. The t-shirts will be provided for them and they can take them home after the evening performance if they paid for them at the beginning of the year. Your child should report to our classroom no later than 5:30 in order to change into their shirt and get their bandanna on. We are looking forward to having you and hope you enjoy the show.

In order to learn more about what we are discussing in our play, the students will be going through a fun rotation around the USA in our classroom. Each student will get a pretend passport that will hold a place for stamps from each location. They will carry a suitcase that will hold their passports as well as brochures they will make from each destination. The students will be put into groups of 4 or 5 and will travel and read about different American symbols and attractions that are important to our history. They will be learning about the Statue of Liberty, Niagra Falls, the Lincoln Memorial, the Liberty Bell, the Bald Eagle, the American Flag, and much more! I hope your child comes home filled with excitement and information to share with you!
