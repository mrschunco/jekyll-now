Thank you to all the families who came out last Thursday night to see all the kids hard work. They were excited to have you come to the classroom to show off their space. Open House is always an exciting night for families and teachers. It was great to see all the families together and enjoying their kids.

On another note, I wanted to share with you some exciting tools we are learning about and using in the classroom. They are called fidgets. A fidget is a small object that keeps your hands busy so you can pay attention to the teacher. You can hold it in your hands, feel it, move it, and play with it while looking at the teacher! Students that need a fidget are often those who have trouble paying attention in class or that need to tap their pencil, or are tempted to play with their table supplies.  I am trying to get the students to understand when they may need a fidget to focus versus the urge to want one just to play with. We have discussed that they are by no means toys in the classroom, but tools to help us focus. We have established some basic ground rules for using them:

  1. You should not need to look at your fidget. Eyes on the teacher!
  2. You should not try to get your friend&#8217;s attention with the fidget.
  3. The fidget must stay in your hands or on your desk.
  4. A fidget must be selected before a lesson starts and can&#8217;t be changed.

If a student breaks any of these rules, they loose the privilege of using one for the rest of the day. If they break the rules each time having one, then they may loose it for the week or for the year. So far it seems to be helping some students really focus in class! Check out the fidgets I bought for our class! These were found at the Dollar Tree!
