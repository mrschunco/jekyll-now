Welcome back to school! Our first week back was a successful one! We learned all about the classroom, the rules, procedures, and our teacher. We had a lot of fun asking questions and getting to know each other.

On the first day we listened to &#8220;First Day Jitters&#8221; and talked about how even teachers get butterflies in theirÂ tummies. The students wrote about what made them nervous the first day. Our class read &#8220;Chyrsanthemum&#8221; and &#8220;Wemberly Worried&#8221; by Kevin Henkes. We wrote and shared about what makes us &#8220;bloom&#8221; and &#8220;wilt&#8221; and what we worried about this year. We shared our &#8220;stars&#8221;-3 things we were already good at, and our 1 wish- something we want to get better at this year. Even Mrs. Chunco wrote one!

Our class read &#8220;Have You Filled a Bucket Today&#8221; and learned what it meant to be a bucket filler and bucket dipper. We shared ways we could fill someones bucket, and then wrote each other nice bucket fillers slips. We can&#8217;t wait to get more and read some of the nice things our friends have said about us! Ask your child about how we all carry an invisible bucket! It&#8217;s pretty cool!

We also listened to the story &#8220;Don&#8217;t Squeal Unless It&#8217;s a Big Deal&#8221;. We talked about tattles and when it&#8217;s important to tell, and when we should try to work something out first. The kids were really good at sorting the situations together in their table groups!

We learned so much this week and have another week full of learning and fun just around the corner. I&#8217;ll keep you updated next week!
