The month of October has come rather quickly, and Room 805 is staying busy! We have so much to look forward to this month. This Thursday we will be visited by firefighter Sara who will talk to 2nd grade about fire safety. Do you know if your smoke detectors work? You might want to check them! Your child may come home and want to talk about a safe meeting place in case there is ever a fire in your home. Does you family have one? Why not make a plan this week to set one up! Those are just a few things your child will be learning during the lesson.

As you may be aware, you child came home with some extra homework this last week. Their assignment is to pick a **fiction** book on their reading level to read and complete a character <img class="wp-image-828 alignright" src="http://www.mrschunco.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/pumpkin-vine-swirly-300x290.png" alt="pumpkin-vine-swirly" width="105" height="102" />pumpkin report. There was an orange packet with detailed directions on how to pick out and decorate the pumpkin based on a character in their book. Please remember that your child must be able to carry the pumpkin by themselves. They can be turned in early if they are done before the due date! Your child will be reading their presentation in front of the class and will be graded on the oral and written report. The pumpkins will then be taken to the library to be on display for the rest of the school to enjoy. We will have them returned before Halloween!

The last exciting event is our 2nd grade play &#8220;Let&#8217;s Sing America&#8221;. Your child is currently learning the songs in music class each week. I will also be passing out play lines this week to students who showed interest in having a part. If you see lines come home with your child, please help them practice them for memorization. Encourage your child to speak loud and clear, reminding them to talk slow as well as with enthusiasm and feeling. We have little time to practice parts in the classroom, so we are counting on parents to help us out! I appreciate your help and support at home. More details will be coming home about the time and date of the play, so keep a look out!
