First off, I would like to thank all the families that came out to our play &#8220;Let&#8217;s Sing America&#8221; Thursday night. The kids did a great job and I was super impressed and proud of them! It was so wonderful to see them so excited and nervous to perform for you! Thank you for all the support at home practicing play parts! It really paid off!

I also want to thank all the families for their hard work on the Pumpkin Book reports. Our little pumpkin patch looks super cute in our classroom. We were able to get through about half of the presentations on Thursday and are looking forward to doing the rest this week. We will be putting the pumpkins on display in the library and will send them home Halloween day so you can display them at your homes! I will be taking more up close pictures of all the pumpkins this week! Here&#8217;s a little sneak peak at our pumpkin book characters! Check back later this week to see more!
