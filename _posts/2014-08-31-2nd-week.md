The second week of school went by even faster than the first! The students are really getting the hang of our classroom routine. TheyÂ have been learning all about Daily 5 centers in reading. So far they have learned how to check out books from our classroom library and put them in their personal book bins. They have practiced reading to themselves and with a partner. On Friday they finally got a chance to do the Word Work center with their friends. We have 3 centers up and going and will add more this next week.

In math we&#8217;ve been learning about place value and making numbers in different ways. The students will be practicing making numbers up to 1,000 and building them with place value blocks and writing them. They got to show their thinking in their math journals too!

In science we are learning about the skills and tools scientists use. We will be exploring how to use such tools and skills in different inquiry activities in our classroom.

The students are also loving Class Dojo, so please sign up. If you need another invitation I&#8217;d be glad to send one out again through e-mail. The students get to change their avatars each Friday if they&#8217;ve earned it through their behavior! Soon they will be getting a code to change it at home, so look out for them!
