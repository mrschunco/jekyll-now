  Hi! My name is Mrs. Chunco and I&#8217;m excited to be your 2nd grade teacher this year! This will be my 9th year teaching at Taylor Ranch. I have taught 3rd, 1st, and 2nd grade. This will be my fourth year of teaching 2nd, and I love it so much! It&#8217;s been my favorite grade so far.

  I have a Masters degree in Elementary Education from the University of Florida. I grew up here in Venice and graduated from Venice High. I also attended school in 4th and 5th grade here at Taylor Ranch! It is really neat to be back here now as a teacher.

  I had always wanted to be a teacher and feel this career is very rewarding. It&#8217;s so amazing to watch children grow and make so many gains. I&#8217;m really looking forward to getting to know you this year and helping you reach your goals.
